            "True Sentiment: neg, Predicted Sentiment: pos, Text: shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . however , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . however , the young writer has a severe case of writer ' s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate ' s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can ' t seem to put words to paper . then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer ' s block . there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it ' s author . ironically , that couldn ' t be truer here . the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character ' s name in the credits . the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth ' s theatres . joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . however , the supporting cast does almost save the day . geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn ' t qualify as real acting . ) . and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn ' t necessarily quality . and this certainly isn ' t quality . perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . simply put , it is far - fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .\n",
            "True Sentiment: pos, Predicted Sentiment: neg, Text: in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year ' s 100 million dollar grossing scream . when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow - up . did it live up to the first film ? the answer is no . jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before . she has been so upset since the incident . nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on . she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle . karla ' s boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food ' s mekhi phifer . freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie ' s boyfriend from a year ago . one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil . of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas . julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie . after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island . it starts off as the weekend of their dreams . something just had to come to mess up the one care - free weekend of julie ' s life though . ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn ' t letting anyone survive this time . will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances . brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film . you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive . matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story . let ' s start with settle . matthew is completely fake in this film . you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth . you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn ' t as good as the first one . he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn ' t clear up the scars he already left on the film . freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was . he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place . we don ' t see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did . mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place . the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better . the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful . there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel . the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film ' s . jennifer love hewitt ' s song , \" how do i deal \" is also played for about thirty seconds . i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes . the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film . before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares . that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes . i think the reason this film wasn ' t as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident . he made them suffer for what they did . in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like . he doesn ' t stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after . he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell . if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense . the bottom line - not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand .\n",

( skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound . in one of the movie ' s most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees . the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . there was no question as to who the movie ' s stars would be . even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination . both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy . there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . there might be some romantic interest , but for now they ' re more interested in their environs than they are in each other . no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . but enough things were done right that the x - files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .\n",

' . of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game - plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . american pie is a hard - fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . i loved the young cast in this movie . consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . but in a teen - dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television ' s sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim ' s uneasy father . scenes in which the familiar father - son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . after levy discovers jim ' s new use for apple pie , he tells him , ` i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . but i never used baked goods . ' it is performances such as his , and bill murray ' s in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . there are some less - than - original aspects of the film . a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex - lax is something we ' ve seen before . if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother ' s dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . secondly , the characters are forced into a half - hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it ' s own , biggs asks his buddies why he ' s going through so much pressure for something that ' s ` not very important anyway . ' and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . in it ' s own way .\n",

( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) and the ultimate resolution to one of the film ' s supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . still , even with the film ' s length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn ' t necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .\n",

g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn ' t . \" rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others ' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self - respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn ' t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer - than - necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film ' s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo ' s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes ' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn ' t ) . the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth - century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas / mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . it would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo ' s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \"\n",

to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke ' s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn ' t seem to approve , doesn ' t do anything to stop it either . by the time this scene takes place , they don ' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . duke seems to realize at some level that he ' s become something he doesn ' t like , but he ' s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co - writers deserve more credit than that . there ' s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the ' 60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren ' t usually very pleasant . unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who ' s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . in its own psychedelic , whacked - out way , it ' s sad and regretful , but i think it ' s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically - induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas - style materialism . indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he ' s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . i ' m not sure if he ' s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .\n",

( he has a $ 6000 a week drug habit . ) ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self - destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . he eventually gets a gig for $ 5000 / week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand - in for \" alf \" : chompers looks just like alf except he ' s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . insert proverbial downward spiral here . permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive - thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . i ' ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive - worse , i ' ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post - there ' s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk - junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack - fueled babble ! stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . but permanent midnight is mostly soulless . when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? and then answers it in the form of bello ' s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn ' t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it ' s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood - types known to man . ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . is this hollywood . . . california ? ) i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he ' s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . so much for the moral of that story . temporary midnight is more like it . - bill chambers ; september , 1998\n",

            "True Sentiment: pos, Predicted Sentiment: neg, Text: based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider - man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half - vampire half - human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire ' s latest meal . now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all . his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires . admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some . judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film . to some degree , i agree with this sentiment . having read comic books since the age of nine ( i ' m 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , # 5 , blade . ( \" men in black \" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book ) why is this ? for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . superman is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher ' s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 ' s television show . batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i ' m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i ' m ready ) . which brings me back to blade . although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider - man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm - and - fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . the end results are not pretty by any means . the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n ' bushe wright . this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . add this to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti - theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . however , the film works best as an action film . actor wesley snipes has an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . regardless , this film is far from perfect . the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . much of the special effects are not that spectacular either . while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film ' s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i ' m really hard to impress ) . the film ' s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , watch \" saving private ryan \" ) . the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . still , scenes involving non - cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade ' s sword without deactivating the \" anti - theft device \" . wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps .\n",

            "True Sentiment: pos, Predicted Sentiment: neg, Text: seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . when it comes to modern gangster movies , it ' s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and / or just using the word \" routine . \" i ' ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it ' s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . it ' s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another ' s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn ' t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . it ' s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . thankfully the film doesn ' t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . he ' s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it ' s easy to sympathize with him . newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . as donnie is constantly impressing and even one - upping lefty , it ' s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . most of the film tells the story of donnie ' s life in mafia , which creates for many sub - plots and individual conflicts , but doesn ' t always seem to come together as a whole . the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . the resonance to donnie ' s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn ' t always seem to have much meaning . back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he ' s never a and the family is suffering . since this is based on a true story i wouldn ' t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . a climax of sorts does occur , but there ' s little feeling of a payoff . we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . aside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . it may be routine , but it ' s good , and that ' s respectful .\n",

( it ' s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) it shouldn ' t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing - room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . anyway , the deceased lawyer ' s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . if this weren ' t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish - out - of - water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who ' s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn ' t know how to act in our society . it also doesn ' t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . and as played by brad pitt , he ' s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he ' s just there . it ' s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" it ' s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . i ' ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt ' s performance with this year ' s best angel performance , nicolas cage ' s in city of angels . where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . cage struck instant chemical sparks with co - star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani ' s character is so shallow that she can ' t see beyond pitt ' s good looks . the movie ' s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn ' t save meet joe black . sir anthony hopkins isn ' t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . he plays one of these good - hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins ' s character more realistically evil . ) hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i ' m sure . i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i ' m asking myself why . movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i ' m going to do now . go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . don ' t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . -- curtis edmonds \" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it . \" -- sideshow bob\n",

            "True Sentiment: pos, Predicted Sentiment: neg, Text: set in the late 80 ' s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co - workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn ' t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . the movie has a similar effect , but at least it ' s less cryptic than ellis ' novel . for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman ' s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith ' s catholic - rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc - 17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . side note # 1 : co - writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill - fated acquaintance of bateman ' s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she ' s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer / director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . it ' s a subtle in - joke and it ' s one i found to be pretty humorous . despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up - and - comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . the real draw here is christian bale and his over - the - top performance as patrick bateman . whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he ' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news ' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co - worker ' s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . side note # 2 : despite the fact that huey lewis ' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don ' t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . i ' m assuming that collins requested the same . on a similar note , whitney houston ' s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn ' t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . apparently , houston wasn ' t as open about the use of her song as the others were . a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film ' s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . don ' t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i ' m still undecided . there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . the scene seemed very dream - like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off - balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman ' s reality ) . i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . it may not change anyone ' s life , but it will certainly have an effect . i know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it .

( maybe spike ' s flick wasn ' t so misguided after all ) . these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you ' ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . it ' s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . one scene in which a slightly de - glamed helen hunt ( de - glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [ her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama ] , hunt ' s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he ' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i ' m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow - ups ; it ' s all very theatrical , especially hunt ' s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn ' t get academy awards . the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it ' s as if we can make out the little munchkin ' s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . naturally osmet is made to play one of those only - in - the - movies children , a martyr - figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . never mind that the two couldn ' t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller - ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap - ish cornball antics . but oh how we love bright , articulate , self - sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . they ' re so adorable . of course the blame can ' t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . the first being the peacemaker , a witless post - cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth ' s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it ' s a movie that treats earth ' s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn ' t as na ? ve as you might think \" she seems to be saying . no , it ' s just horribly confused .\n",

b ) a prohibition - era remake of sergio leone ' s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition - era action drama with a completely original story - line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago - connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle ' s side . but smith ' s allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes - cum - bastardizations . there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses ' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti - hero ' s only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses ' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn ' t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice - over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard - boiled style of pulp detective fiction . yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . with john smith ' s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn ' t work . the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can ' t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . christopher walken plays doyle ' s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft - spoken psychos , and there isn ' t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build - up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill ' s 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter - productive narration . sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they ' ll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about .\n",

( chan ' s first release in this country , \" rumble in the bronx \" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) heck , jackie doesn ' t even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . in condor , chan plays the same character he ' s always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung - fu and slapstick - fu . jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo - nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , \" jackie , save us ! \" , and misuse firearms . the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he ' s more pathetic than evil . en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo - nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop - socky sequence , followed by the film ' s centerpiece , a wind - tunnel fight that ' s even better than the one in face / off . this is where the money was spent , on well - choreographed kung - fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed - up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain ' s legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn ' t he take the key with him ? ) . don ' t worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . just go see the movie . operation condor has pretentions of being a \" raiders of the lost ark \" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a + movie . however , you ' ve got to go with what you ' ve got , and what you ' ve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .\n",

it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film ' s constant barrage of humor . when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba ' ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . since they ' ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean - luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard ' s trademark , with his usual aplomb . brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android - wishing - to - be - human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . despite many other critics ' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru ' afro well enough . ru ' afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . like the baron , ru ' afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . in one particularly memorable scene , ru ' afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . ru ' afro is no khan from star trek ii -- the best trek villain ever -- but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba ' ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . a particular plot point involving anij ' s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection ' s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru ' afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn ' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . despite star trek : insurrection ' s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . it maintains roddenberry ' s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don ' t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . i ' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . rated pg , i can ' t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .\n",

) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . the film ' s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle - aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband ' s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high - quality stuff . for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace ' s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can ' t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big - time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn ' t want matthew to end up in jail . it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . this ' unhip ' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle - aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . ummm !\n",

quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . m : i - 2 opens and closes with fast - paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film ' s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . it ' s a mega - buck film adapted from a popular high - tech gadgetry tv series . but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . john woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face / off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung - fu kicks , slo - mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can ' t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . the star of the film and co - producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action - film girl , and seems like a fish - out - of - water in this one . their romance didn ' t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn ' t convincing . the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . which explains the film ' s mythic theme . . . as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one - dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia - like clone . he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face / off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high - gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self - destruct in five seconds . actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self - destructed at this point . in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex - boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide - out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean ' s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick - boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick ' s everyone ' s ass . if i was only entertained by this . . . i could have lived with it . but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam - dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . in any case , this is a critic - proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into .\n",

( especially hercules ) . . . emotion . all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren ' t going to hold anyone ' s interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . not since disney ' s beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . the story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film . anastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) . but anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins . the grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution . a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money . they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov . the plot is actually quite well structured . there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they ' ll never have time to be bored . what this really means is that the adults won ' t be bored by it either . there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses . there is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin ' s pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film . however , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly . the animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators . not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them . even without the voices , they act . the musical number in paris is a show - stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style . as with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top - 40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) . the songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that ' s so much fun , it ' s okay . . . ) . i can ' t reccomend anastasia highly enough . it ' s a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics . kids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it ' s also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney .\n",

        "Discussing the result:\n",
        "Train Accuracy: 0.99625, Test Accuracy: 0.7625\n",
        "\n",
        "The results indicate that the Naive Bayes classifier achieved high accuracy on the training set (approximately 99.63%) but slightly lower accuracy on the test set (approximately 76.25%). Let's discuss these results:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Training Accuracy:\n",
        "   - The high training accuracy suggests that the classifier has effectively learned from the training data. It has likely captured the patterns and features that distinguish between different sentiments in the training set. However, achieving almost perfect accuracy on the training data could also indicate overfitting, where the model has memorized the training examples instead of learning generalizable patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Testing Accuracy:\n",
        "   - The testing accuracy, while slightly lower than the training accuracy, is still relatively high. This indicates that the classifier can generalize well to unseen data, despite the drop in accuracy compared to the training set. However, the lower accuracy on the test set suggests that the classifier might not perform as well on new, unseen data compared to the data it was trained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Possible Reasons for Performance Discrepancy:\n",
        "   - Overfitting: The performance gap between training and test accuracies suggests potential overfitting. The classifier might have memorized noise or specific patterns in the training data that do not generalize well to unseen data. To address overfitting, techniques like regularization or increasing the size and diversity of the training data could be beneficial.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Data Quality: The quality of the training and test data could impact the performance of the classifier. If the data is noisy, inconsistent, or contains biases, it can affect the classifier's ability to learn and generalize. Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques may help mitigate these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Model Complexity: The complexity of the Naive Bayes classifier could also influence its performance. While Naive Bayes is a relatively simple and efficient algorithm, it may struggle with capturing complex relationships and nuances in the data. Using more sophisticated models or feature engineering techniques could potentially improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Solutions:\n",
        "   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters, such as smoothing parameters in the Naive Bayes classifier, could help optimize performance.\n",
        "   - Experimenting with different feature extraction techniques or model architectures might lead to better results.\n",
        "   - Cross-validation or bootstrapping could provide more robust estimates of the classifier's performance and help identify sources of variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some general Misclassifications:\n",
        "1. False Positives (Negative Reviews Misclassified as Positive):\n",
        "- \"The movie was terrible, with poor acting and a predictable plot, but I loved the soundtrack.\"\n",
        "=> The classifier may have focused too much on the presence of positive words like \"loved\" and \"soundtrack\" while ignoring the negative sentiment expressed in the rest of the sentence.\n",
        "2. False Negatives (Positive Reviews Misclassified as Negative):\n",
        "- \"Although the film had some flaws, the cinematography was stunning and the acting was superb.\"\n",
        "=> The classifier may have been misled by the presence of negative words like \"flaws\" while failing to recognize the overall positive sentiment expressed in the sentence.\n",
        "3. Ambiguous Sentiments:\n",
        "- \"The movie was okay, but it didn't live up to my expectations.\"\n",
        "=> The classifier may struggle with sentences containing mixed or ambiguous sentiments, where positive and negative expressions coexist. It may not accurately weigh the overall sentiment of the sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are samples similar to the said ones in the dataset which lead to the misclassification.(like this one: i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister . twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with . but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo ... also . . . there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting . so . . . it was good ! ! => True Sentiment: pos, Predicted Sentiment: neg which is a sample of Ambiguous Sentiment.)\n"
